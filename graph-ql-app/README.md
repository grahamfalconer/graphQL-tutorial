**React Apollo**
React Apollo allows you to fetch data from your GraphQL server and use it in building complex and reactive UIs using the React framework. React Apollo may be used in any context that React may be used. In the browser, in React Native, or in Node. js when you want to do server-side rendering.

Apollo Boost is a zero-config way to start using Apollo Client. It includes some sensible defaults, such as our recommended InMemoryCache and HttpLink , which come configured for you with our recommended settings.
